      </p>
      <br />
      <p>4. HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE YOUR INFORMATION</p>
      <p>
        We are committed to making sure your privacy is protected when you use our Service and when we collect
        information from you. We take the security of your information seriously and implement a variety of security
        measures to maintain the safety of all Personal Information you provide. We also make sure that third parties we
        use to process your Personal Information also use appropriate security measures to protect your data.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        When we collect sensitive information like your credit card information, that information is encrypted and
        securely transmitted. For example, we use a secure server for transmitting sensitive information. All supplied
        sensitive/credit card information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted
        into our payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights
        to such systems and are required to keep the information confidential. You can verify that this sensitive
        information is being transmitted securely by looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the webpage.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>After a transaction is completed, your sensitive information will not be stored on our servers.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The safety and security of your information also depends on you. We urge you to be careful about entering
        information on public computers or on public networks.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our
        best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information
        transmitted to or stored on our Service.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>5. DO NOT TRACK (DNT) SIGNALS</p>
      <p>
        We participate in interest-based advertising and use third-party advertising companies to serve you targeted
        advertisements based on your browsing history. For more information about how targeted advertising works, you
        can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at
        http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We may also work with third-party partners who employ tracking technologies or the application of statistical
        modeling tools to determine if two or more devices are linked to a single user or household so that content you
        see on one device can result in relevant advertising on another device, to perform analytics, and to measure the
        performance of our advertising campaigns.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Although we do our best to honor your privacy preferences, we are unable to respond to Do Not Track signals set
        by your browser.
